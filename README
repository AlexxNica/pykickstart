This is pykickstart-2, a python2 and python3 library for reading, writing, and
manipulating kickstart files.  kickstart files are used to automate the
anaconda installer, among other purposes.

This is the latest released version of pykickstart, but it is not the latest
version of the library in source control.  Please see docs/2to3 for an
explanation of how to migrate your code to the latest version.  The 2.x series
will raise deprecation warnings in various places that the 2to3 document
covers.  The 3.x series will substantially change parts of the library,
breaking existing code.  The 2.x series will not be going away any time soon,
but it is suggested you start migrating your code now.
